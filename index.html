      <p>Oriol Vidal-CortÃ©s was born in Barcelona on the 19th of November of 1989. He grew up as a tennis player and, after graduating from high school, got an athletic full-tuition scholarship to compete for Ferris State University, MI, USA, while majoring in Biotechnology. He was not a vocational scientist, but found biology really interesting, reason why upon graduation he moved back home and continued onto grad school to obtain a MSc in Advanced Immunology from the University of Barcelona. His excellence as a student allowed him to obtain a research scholarship at the Vall d'Hebron Research Institue in Barcelona and pursued a PhD in the field of Oncology. However, during that process, he came to realize that he did not love what he was doing. He kept on going for some time, until the day he discovered code. He started getting into web development, went mad, took a leap of faith, quit his science career, and attended a coding bootcamp to change his life. The first language he learned was Ruby, which was a great one to begin with. Right after that, he got a job as a junior developer at Amenitiz, a start-up in the IT sector. After his contract eneded he moved to Zurich, Switzerland, with his partner, in search of a new beginning and a bright future.</p>
